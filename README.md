## Introduction to Python for Engineers and Manufacturers

This respository contains the content for the "Introduction to Python for Engineers and Manufacturers" chapter event
as produced by SME Chapter 112. This event is designed to demonstrate the benefits of using a programming lanugage
(in this case, Python) to solve domain-specific problems in physical engineering disciplines.

All Python code in this repository uses Python 3.
